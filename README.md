Just as one needs to get accustomed to working with words and grammatical structures to learn a speaking language to build language literacy and fluency, we now live in a time where we need to work to improve data literacy with the goal of becoming data fluent. The world is changing at a faster pace than ever before and one way to get a handle on this is through the use of data.

In this course, you’ll build towards data fluency and be empowered to think about how you can access data, interpret data, integrate data with your expertise, and act with data.


## Building skills with data

The amount of data that surrounds you is increasing at speeds the world has never seen before. How do you not get lost in this world of data abundance? How do you read the appropriate signals from data and ensure you aren’t being lost in the noise?

You can build data skills and become data fluent by understanding the steps needed to work with data and how that data can be turned into business value. You needn’t be a highly technical person to be data fluent. Computers have increased in power and speed more and more over time. To be data fluent is as much about being able to set up problems appropriately with data and to interpret the results of the analyses. This doesn’t necessarily mean you need to be an experienced programmer who writes and tests code to be data fluent.

Think about language fluency again. You can be fluent in, say, Portuguese, but still make mistakes every now and then with the language. Maybe there is an idiom that you aren’t quite sure about or maybe your pronunciation is a little off on some words. The same is true with data fluency. You needn’t be perfect with data, but you should be shooting to be consistent and aiming to improve as you learn more and more about how you and your company manage and work with data to draw insights.

## Data literacy

To be data fluent, you must first know how to read about, write about, and further communicate with data. In other words, you must be data literate to get on the path towards data fluency. Thus, data literacy can be explained as the skill of reading, examining/exploring, and discussing data in effective ways. Data fluency comes with being able to take these data literacy skills to the next level by identifying how to act with the data.

## Structure of the course

When we talk about reading data, we often think of that as how to access data. That will be our first main topic in this course. This pertains to identifying which data sources are meaningful to your work, how you will go about finding and collecting this data, and how will this data be managed in the moment as well as archived for future use.

The second main topic of this course is about examining and exploring data. This is often done via data analysis and data visualization.

The third main topic of this course is on integrating data with your expertise of the business. This ties closely with being able to communicate well about your data, to identify potential biases or problems in your data, and the need to have subject matter experts available to both check your results and also go to for questions about the data as needed.

The last topic of this course is on taking action with your data. This involves identifying schemes and mechanisms that will work best in helping you and your team(s) work with and improve data analyses going forward.
